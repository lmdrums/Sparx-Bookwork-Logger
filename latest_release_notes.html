        <h2>Tired of bookwork checks?</h2>
        <h3>This project was designed to minimise the effort you have to put in to your Sparx homework.</h3>
        <p>Getting simple questions and having to write them down question after question can get annoying. This program <b>automatically</b> takes a screenshot after every question and saves it to a folder.</p>
        <p>Whenever a bookwork check comes up, it retrieves that image and displays it in the GUI.</p>

        <h2>Release Notes:</h2>
        <h3>Release Notes for Sparx Bookwork Logger v1.1.0</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a .msi Windows installer for installation of the application to make it easier.</li>
            <li>Updated README with .msi section instead of .exe and tweaked a few bits (added install Git to Python section of installation).</li>
            <li>Updated code - fixed a bug where bookwork checks didn't come up automatically in the GUI.</li>
            <li>Updated notification engine to <i>win11toast</i> as some issues were run into when using <i>notify-py</i> from Win11.</li>
            <li>Changed .env and .txt file to single .ini settings file for ease.</li>
            <li>Added feature when you type in a bookwork code into the search box. If the length of the bookwork code is greater than 2, it will highlight the border red.</li>
            <li>Got rid of the need to reload window after editing settings.</li>
            <li>Fixed some bugs with resource_path.</li>
        </ul>
